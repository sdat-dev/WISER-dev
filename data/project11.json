For example, after the 2016-2018 gypsy moth outbreaks, more than 4,000 km2 forest area were damaged in New England. Unhealthy trees pose big risks to electric infrastructure as they are more likely to fall during storms and could result in wide-scale power outages. As a result, identification of stressed trees along roads is important to minimize damage during storms and maintain system reliability. In recent years, vast amount of forests has undergone different kinds of disturbances, which exacerbates the vulnerability of power grids to extreme weather statewide. By using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) data, this project will provide Neal-real-time Assessment of Forest Risk to Infrastructure (NAFRI) by monitoring and assessing the health conditions of trees. This innovation can result in early identification of various kinds of forest disturbance, such as gypsy moth infection. Utility companies can conduct preventive tree trimming at specific locations before the next storm season. The goal of our research is to help Utilities managing roadside and Right-of-way (ROW) forests to increase storm resistance, thereby reducing weather-related power outages. To make vegetation management more efficient, we will produce forest disturbance maps from 2015 to 2021 and estimated time, location, and intensity of disturbance events. We will classify roadside forest disturbance agents based on our preliminary findings and assess vegetation risk in the future. Rapidly updated vegetation risk database could be an important input to outage prediction model and make pre-storm resource allocation more effectively."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"zhe.zhu@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":"Neal-real-time Assessment of Forest Risk to Infrastructure Using Satellite","name":"Dr. Zhe Zhu","project":"Project11","link":"researchers.html#ZheZhu"}]}
