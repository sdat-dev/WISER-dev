In the forested northeast, damaged trees account up to 90% of outages during storms. Mitigating vegetation risk to infrastructure is therefore a major challenge in highly forested areas. There are two major factors that could increase forest risk to infrastructure – the physical structure and health condition of trees. The physical structure of trees can affect their resistance and exposure to damaging winds. Trees that mature in dense forest conditions tend to be poorly adapted to strong winds when they become exposed on a new forest edge. Tall trees that protrude above the forest canopy have more “sail” area than co-dominant trees and winds exert greater leverage on their trunks which increases the chance of wind throw or stem breakage. Thus, it is important to create datasets of tree physical structure (e.g., canopy roughness, closure, and edge change) to better assess vegetation risk to infrastructure. On the other hand, tree health condition is also a major factor that contributes to vegetation risk to infrastructure. Disturbances caused by stress factors, such as insect and disease will affect health and vitality of forest significantly, and the unhealthy trees are more likely to fall during storms. Rapidly dispersing disturbances, such as Gypsy moth can trigger large area of tree mortality, raising concerns along utility corridors. Detailed characterization of tree health and mortality can assist in minimizing risk on infrastructure and accurate inventorying of dead trees for removal operations. On-demand assessment of storm related damages to infrastructure is of great importance for identifying hazardous conditions, situational awareness, and emergency planning operations."},{"type":"p","content":"Remote sensing technology is capable of monitoring and assessing tree and forest conditions across vast areas. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can measure 3D structural characteristics of tree crowns and forest canopies and optical imagery acquired from satellites and aircrafts can provide information on vegetation health. Satellite imagery derived vegetation risk maps could be important input to models that seek to predict the location and rate of electrical outages during storms, such as the UConn Storm Outage Prediction Model. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) outfitted with imaging cameras and 3D laser scanning sensors enable the collection of actionable data - downed trees, wires, poles in accessibility limited (blocked roads) and unsafe condition - to inform damage response efforts in safe, timely, and cost-effective fashion. Combing existing geospatial information on soils and a variety of other environmental conditions with vegetation structure and health can help developing spatially explicit models to guide utilities and regulators to better prioritize where to implement resource-intensive vegetation management and resilience programs."},{"type":"p","content":"Build on our on-going research with the Eversource Energy Center at UConn and Eversource Energy, we propose to investigate; 1) Near-real time vegetation health monitoring using satellite imagery, 2) Forest structure modelling using LiDAR, and 3) post-storm damage mapping using UAS and high-resolution satellite imagery."},{"type":"p","content":"1. Vegetation health monitoring:  We will create the first near-real-time (updated in every 5-days) and high-spatial-resolution (10-meter) monitoring system that can provide precise location of forest disturbance, characterize of the type of forest disturbance (e.g., wind, flood, harvest, mechanical, stress, etc.), and evaluate forest disturbance risk to Eversource infrastructure in Connecticut based on very dense time series of Senitnle-2 data. With this monitoring system, we can provide high risk locations immediately after forest disturbance, which can be very useful for decision makers and infrastructure mangers. This research will work closely with Eversource, and its historical record of storms impacted areas will be used as a major input to calibrate our infrastructure risk models. We will test and improve the recently developed Continuous monitoring of land disturbance (COLD) algorithm (Zhu et al., 2020) applying on Sentinel-2 data to detect forest disturbance in near-real-time at high-spatial-resolution. This approach has proved its capability in monitoring a variety of land disturbance based on dense Landsat time series observations."},{"type":"p","content":"2. Forest structure modelling: Our previous research has shown that the Connecticut statewide LiDAR dataset, which is freely available, can accurately model various tree and forest characteristics include canopy height and density. Roughness indices can be developed and applied to LiDAR-based canopy height models to identify the prevalence of trees protruding above the forest canopy. Connecticut is covered by multi-temporal LiDAR datasets which can allow for forest disturbances to be mapped over 2-to-6-year time periods depending on the location in the state.  Connecticut’s Changing Landscape (CCL) land cover data can allow for longer-term forest disturbances to be identified, although at a coarser resolution. This task will use freely available statewide LiDAR and land cover datasets to model forest canopy roughness and closure as well as changes in the forest edge location. Each model will be integrated into the “proximity tree” model developed in previous work (Parent et al. 2019) which indicates the locations of risk trees which are within striking distance of power lines. We will identify and quantify the risk associated by each forest disturbances per conductor-mile. Eversource’s outage data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of these integrated models in predicting outages. Models will be incorporated into the decision support tool based on either empirical evidence or strong support from the scientific literature."},{"type":"p","content":"3. Rapid post-storm damage assessment: Low-cost UASs can be rapidly deployed by utility personnel to evaluate damages and acquire first-hand information, such as downed trees, power lines, and poles. Multispectral and thermals cameras and 3D laser scanning sensors can be vested on UASs to acquire detailed information about the storm damage.  When the UAS deployments coupled with commercial satellite products, such as Planet satellites that collect images of the entire globe every day with a resolution of 3 m, it is possible to readily scale-up post-damage assessments to large areas. Satellite imagery from past events and UASs flights outfitted with multiple sensors over simulated scenarios will be used as baseline information to explore the potentials of platforms/data and to develop automated algorithms. We will closely collaborate with our utility partner – Eversource Energy - to scope their specific UAS-based mapping needs in post-storm situations. Based on their inputs we will develop new algorithms enabled with software interfacing to produce UAS-based analytics."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"cthorncroft@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"Vegetation Risk Analysis","Number":"Project10"},"name":"Dr. Christopher Thorncroft ","project":"Project10","link":"researchers.html#ChristopherThorncroft"},{"email":"chandi.witharana@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"Vegetation Risk Analysis","Number":"Project10"},"name":"Dr. Chandi Witharana","project":"Project10","link":"researchers.html#ChandiWitharana"},{"email":"zhe.zhu@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"Vegetation Risk Analysis","Number":"Project10"},"name":"Dr. Zhe Zhu","project":"Project10","link":"researchers.html#ZheZhu"}]}
