The US Department of Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has designated 16 wind planning areas and issued 13 renewable energy leases in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast coastal waters (BOEM). There is still, however, a large gap in our understanding of meteorological-oceanographic (“met-ocean”) physics and dynamics as it relates to the spectrum of activities (e.g., resource assessment, operations, and maintenance [O&M], forecasting) associated with the siting and operation of offshore wind energy facilities."},{"type":"p","content":"For this proposed research topic, IUCRC will enable academia, government, and industry to explore and develop the best pathways to predict the spectrum of met-ocean environment conditions, thereby identifying with appropriate and representative turbine and plant performance characteristics, reducing costs, and facilitating the siting, operation, and maintenance of offshore wind energy facilities. More accurate forecasts and realistic depictions of the met-ocean environment are necessary for more reliable assessments of energy production and load matching potential, and for project planning and financing. Better forecasts will also ensure equipment, including wind turbines and balance of plant infrastructure such as foundations, substations, and electrical cables, are operating within specifications, providing real time estimates of loads on exposed and rotating hardware components, and will safeguard vessel and labor operations. Additionally, extreme event forecasting (e.g., Nor’Easters) will support better predictions of ramp events resulting from turbine high-wind de-rates and cut-outs."},{"type":"p","content":"OWRAFT will:"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Minimize barriers associated with the siting (resource assessment and other met-ocean studies) deployment (construction), O&M, and forecasting of the wind resource."},{"type":"li","content":"Accelerate and/or support the implementation of products enabled by offshore wind energy datasets."},{"type":"li","content":"Engage the weather, climate, energy, and transportation communities, and policy makers, to move these technologies forward."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Specific Objectives and Milestones: </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Acquiring and documenting historical met-ocean baseline data sets to be used for development and training of OWRAFT;"},{"type":"li","content":"Identifying significant deficiencies in existing numerical weather prediction (NWP) modeling systems for various weather phenomena affecting the siting, development, and operations of offshore wind energy facilities."},{"type":"li","content":"Coupling and testing the NWP, data assimilation, and machine learning components of the OWRAFT; and"},{"type":"li","content":"Developing, implementing, and validating OWRAFT by working with IURCR members and other stakeholders."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Proposed First Year and End of Project Deliverables: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"For the first year we intend to complete objectives 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 referenced above.
