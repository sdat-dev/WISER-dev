The WISER’s site at UConn will combine expertise from weather and climate scientists, water and energy resource engineers, electrical and cyber security engineers, and economists to investigate the effects that a transition towards a low-carbon electricity system in the Northeast will have on the region’s electricity grid system, demand, and economy.  Furthermore, the WISER team will identify optimal patterns of transition based on climate, technical, and socioeconomic parameters.  Specific research will include these integrated themes:"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Advanced power electronics converters for renewable energy systems:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Efficient power electronic conversion technologies in power generation, power transmission/distribution and end-user applications are essential to enable the use of clean energy resources. Intermittent supply and different characteristics of renewable resources can render system control and stability more challenging.  During the winter, high production is expected from hydro while solar declines; summer sees a reversed pattern. PV production is zero during nighttime whereas wind and hydro plants can still provide the power at that time. Additionally, during fault conditions, some parts of distribution systems might need to switch to an off-grid mode operation as a microgrid. To increase stability and reliability of the system, renewable integration scenarios need to be investigated based on various weather conditions and renewable generators have to participate in frequency and voltage support.  Additionally, energy storage systems are critical for buffering variability in renewable resources to ensure an uninterruptible power supply.  An optimization algorithm or even a trade-off needs to be studied for renewable integration to determine an optimal level of stability and cost.  Moreover, hybrid power plants, such as wind and PV, or Wind, PV, and energy storage systems, should be assessed for efficiency in renewable energy source utilization [1]."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Renewable energy production vulnerability to extreme events:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"The boost in variability brought about by RES into an energy generation portfolio, which is quickly moving away from stable sources, demands the study of vulnerabilities in electric energy production to resiliency events in a changing climate.  Assessing what would happen if a severe storm will hit a region heavily dependent on renewable resources is a critical research question needing a quantitative answer.  During a storm, off-shore and on-shore wind farms must be shut down when winds exceed certain thresholds, PV energy production will be minimal, and pre-storm flood control may compromise hydropower production.  Moreover, power outages in transmission and distribution systems which may cut out some distributed energy sources or limit the transmission of power from other areas will complicate matters. Investigating storms conditions leading to the simultaneous shut down of renewable energy sources over an entire region will be fundamental for minimizing the impact of rare extreme weather events. Vulnerability to weather extremes, together with optimal integration scenarios under fair weather conditions, and an assessment of cyber and physical security or renewable resources will all be contributing factors in the evaluation of the optimal pace for a safe transition towards a cleaner future."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Integrating supply-side energy variability through advanced forecasting:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Uncertainty and variability of wind and solar generation pose challenges for grid operation. Variability in generation resources requires actions to balance the power grid system. Sufficient flexibility in the system is needed to accommodate supply-side variability of energy, and to maintain appropriate generation levels to meet demand. Sometimes wind generation increases as loads increases, but in cases when generation increases and load levels fall (or vice versa), additional actions to balance the system are needed. System operators need to ensure that they have sufficient resources to accommodate significant up or down ramps in wind generation to maintain system balance. Wind and solar power forecasting can help reduce the uncertainty of variable renewable generation. The use of forecasts helps grid operators more efficiently commit or decommit generators to accommodate changes in generation and prepare for extreme events. For unit commitment decisions two products are typically used real-time and day-ahead forecasts. Accurate forecasts drive operational efficiency and cost savings. Real-time forecasts are used to determine the need for a quick-start generator, demand response of other mitigating options and this drive reliability. Intermittence nowcasting and power ramp forecasting methods are currently being improved with the use of fast and dense observing networks."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Storage capacity and renewables co-generation designs: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Energy storage, especially at industrial and utility scales are currently extremely expensive. Co-generation of renewables such as hydro-solar scheduling or the pumped-hydro-electric energy storage (PHP) are established technologies that can be oriented to improve capability of peak shaving services and price arbitrage.  Energy storage by pumping water from a lower to an upper reservoir to utilize excess PV energy for instance can offer potential solution for the sustainable integration of renewables.

First, a tremendous increase in the number of RESs that have a significant dependency on digital communication and control, requires a wide-area communication system to monitor and control them. Second, these components are usually owned and controlled by different stakeholders, which must implement hierarchical administrative domains to monitor and manage their own devices. Third, different communication standards of various RESs render the ICT system more complicated and challenging. A successful cyberattack might not only cause a loss of personal and commercial data, but also damage physical assets and finances by disrupting generation, and even national energy security risks in the event of cascading failures or system blackouts. Therefore, analysis and assessment for cyber and physical security are critical to ensure a secure integration of RES."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Electrical and driverless vehicle adoption:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Investigate the socioeconomic effects of transitioning towards a low-carbon electricity mix, including effects on electricity demand, and effects of investments in energy infrastructures at regional level.
