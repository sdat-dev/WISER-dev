{"webelements":[{"type":"ph","content":"Climate Change and Renewable Energy","logo":"climatechange-projects.jpg"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Background</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Most states in the US are aggressively integrating greater amounts of renewable energy (i.e., wind, solar, and, in some cases, hydropower) into the power grid. Climate change, however, will likely affect the current generation and the future distribution of renewable energy resources on a variety of spatio-temporal scales. This redistribution of renewable energy potential may be disruptive to the nation’s current plans, policies, and goals, including state renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse reduction programs that target 100% renewable generation by the 2040s in some of the nation’s largest markets (e.g., New York and California). Thus, the scope of this research will be to develop an integrated (wind, solar, and hydropower) high resolution (6 km or finer) national data set showing the potential future (through the end of the 21st century) changes in the distribution of renewable energy generation. As of 2020, the US generated approximately 10% of its energy from renewables ((EIA) 2020). Thus, rapid development of the nation’s potential renewable energy resources will need to consider how a changing climate may affect the attainability of these targets. UAlbany, through ASRC and DAES, under the sponsorship NYSERDA, have already partnered with AWS Truepower (AWST) and Mano Nanotechnologies, Inc. (MNI) in developing information that will facilitate meeting New York State’s goals and objectives in addressing climate change in the context of renewable energy generation (Freedman et al. 2020). This work will provide a pathway for expanding such work nation-wide, through the IUCRC nexus of cooperation amongst academia, industry, state, and federal stakeholders."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Research plan:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"An overarching goal of the proposed work will be to identify potential changes to the distribution of the renewable energy resources in the US. Estimated uncertainties will be assessed using available historic data sets and the latest Earth System Model projections available from the International Panel on Climate Change Climate Model Inter-comparison Projects (Eyring et al. 2016; Taylor et al. 2012) and leveraging work done by Freedman et al. (2020). This will be accomplished through the use of various modeling and statistical techniques (including the use high resolution mesoscale model and dynamic downscaling). Results will provide insight into how regional scale weather patterns influencing the nation’s climate regimes will be affected by climate change during the remainder of this century. Targeted users, such as utilities, federal and state agencies and authorities, local, state, and regional planners, and Independent System Operators, Regional Transmission Operators, and Balancing Authorities, will be able to leverage the unparalleled resources of the IUCRC to better understand how climate change will affect the availability and distribution of renewable energy resources."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Specific Objectives:  </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Gather and analyze existing databases and modeling sensitivity studies examining the effects of climate change on US renewable energy resources (include Freedman et al. 2020 NYSERDA study)."},{"type":"li","content":"Identify Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model members that can be used for downscale modeling runs for detection and attribution of potential trends in renewable energy resources (I.e., 100 m wind speed and surface irradiance)."},{"type":"li","content":"Set up and test downscaling modeling system (using the Weather Research and Forecast modeling system)."},{"type":"li","content":"Run downscaling experiments for historical (2001 – 2020) and future (2021 – 2070) periods encompassing the CONUS."},{"type":"li","content":"Estimate changes and uncertainties in potential power production attributed to climate change."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Milestones:  </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Milestone 1 (year 1; months 1 - 6): Review previous studies, literature, and ongoing Freedman et al.
