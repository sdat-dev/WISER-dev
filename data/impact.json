[{"type":"ph","content":"IMPACT","logo":"impact.jpg"},{"type":"p","content":"The research directions of WISER are mandated by actual and urging national energy industry problems. \r\nDisruption to everyday lives, safety issues, economic and infrastructure losses are some of the multi-faceted impacts due to extensive power outages. As power outages get predicted more accurately and \r\nrestoration times are minimized, the outcomes from this project will directly benefit society. The predictive \r\nmodels to be developed will be expanded to support utility preparedness and restoration decision support \r\nsystems for power outages associated with a variety of causes, ranging from severe storms to wildfire \r\nignition conditions in the West and heatwaves in the Midwest. Furthermore, the models to be developed \r\ncan also be used with long-term atmospheric reanalysis or climate projection datasets to derive \r\nvulnerabilities of the power grid infrastructure to storms and climate hazards."},{"type":"p","content":"Furthermore, research in the WISER will improve understanding of the environmental and forest \r\ncharacteristics that are predictive of tree failure and which can be quantified through remote sensing and \r\ngeospatial analysis. Our vegetation management projects build on substantial prior work by the UConn \r\nStormwise program and the Eversource Energy Center, both of which combine academic research and \r\nextension programs in a collaborative relationship with industry partners (Eversource, Avangrid) and \r\ngovernmental agencies (CT Dept. of Energy and Environmental Protection, CT Public Utility Regulatory \r\nAuthority). The research and practical implementation information developed in WISER are broadly relevant \r\nto utility programs across all geographies and could help to promote grid resilience nationally in the face of \r\nincreasing storm frequency and severity. The proposed research would help improve broad scale \r\nmanagement of forests to reduce risk to infrastructure, forest damage and resulting losses of ecological \r\nand economic productivity."},{"type":"p","content":"WISER research would also help utilities to more effectively improve electric grid resilience to windstorm \r\nevents, which will benefit society by reducing the number and duration of power outages and the hazards \r\nand economic losses associated with them. Specifically, knowledge derived from the proposed projects \r\nwould help utilities more effectively target locations of greatest need for vegetation management and other \r\nresilience programs, implement the most effective resilience strategies for a given location, and justify their \r\nmitigation approaches to regulatory agencies and the public. In addition, findings would help guide \r\nregulators in developing more effective policies to address vegetation-related threats to resilience of the \r\npower grid. Specific tree and forest management approaches will be communicated and demonstrated to \r\nstakeholders, and outreach efforts, to facilitate implementation of management strategies, will be targeted \r\nbased on ethnographic research and decision support scenario modeling."},{"type":"p","content":"WISER will recruit graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups to increase \r\nminority participation in science and engineering and especially interdisciplinary collaborations and \r\nexposure to industry-academia partnerships. The Eversource Energy Center at UConn has recently \r\nestablished a diversity scholarship to engage underrepresented minority undergraduate students in \r\nresearch projects that span all energy-related thematic areas. UAlbany’s Department of Atmospheric and \r\nEnvironmental Sciences (DAES) and Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) Atmospheric \r\nResearch team has an Inclusion and Diversity Committee that has released a Commitment to Equity \r\nroadmap to increase diversity. This roadmap provides recommendations and tasks toward achieving \r\ngreater equity and a more welcoming culture in DAES and ASRC. We will leverage the Center’s new \r\ndiversity actions as well as UAlbany and UConn’s long record of successful programs and partnerships that \r\nsupport STEM diversity to foster a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce."}]
