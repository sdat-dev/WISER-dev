There is a pressing need for improving the predictive accuracy, and characterize the uncertainty of these models, which is caused by an incomplete understanding of the complex interaction of factors responsible for the occurrence of weather-related power outages, and uncertainties and errors in weather forecasts propagating in impact models."},{"type":"p","content":"Inter-disciplinary collaborations between UConn and UAlbany researchers and faculty members with varying expertise (atmospheric sciences AS, civil and environmental engineering CEE, natural resources and the environment NRE, and computer science and engineering CSE) will be triggered in this project by the common goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in outage prediction to fulfill utility industry needs on storm preparedness and restoration. Some of the expected collaborations will be aimed at addressing current outage prediction challenges through (i) investigation of additional variables derived from new remote sensing products to help characterize the conditions prone to outages (CEE and NRE), (ii) exploration of new AI/ML techniques and combination of input variables (CSE and CEE), and (iii) study of new methods for reducing and/or characterizing the uncertainty of weather variables relevant to outage forecasting under different storm conditions (AS and CEE)."},{"type":"p","content":"Limitations and uncertainty in weather prediction will be quantified by probabilistic weather forecasts with dynamic and/or analog ensemble techniques (Yang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019) which will be built through collaboration of AS researchers from UConn and UAlbany and augmented by publicly available ensemble or deterministic forecasts from various federal sources. In addition, data assimilation capabilities using weather observations from state and federal sources will support error reduction of each high-resolution weather forecast for the territory of interest."},{"type":"p","content":"A reduction of weather forecasting uncertainties and the consequent improvements in outage prediction will allow to augment the storm impact-forecasting framework by providing an Estimated Time to Restoration (ETR) for the expected outages. Recently, at UConn, an Agent-Based Model (ABM) has been developed for simulating the outage restoration process (Walsh et al., 2018). The UConn ABM for ETR is based on the movement of utility crews on the road network towards outage locations in the electric distribution networks, and on the time spent to restore each outage, under different assumptions of road and environmental conditions, and decision rules. The ABM is used to simulate the restoration process after storm events and evaluate optimal restoration scenarios relative to the actual restoration curve. OPM advances will allow to more reliably predict the expected number of outage locations, which will be used as input to the ABM to estimate the restoration process in advance of storms. Interfacing the ABM with the OPM will make this framework a unique real-time decision support tool for outage restoration management through the simulation of crew and equipment allocation scenarios. A close collaboration with electric utility emergency preparedness and restoration managers and utility engineering teams is fundamental to leverage on the large amount of data collected by electric utilities and to implement the decision rules which guide the movement of crews during the post-storm outage restoration. Eversource and AVANGRID, two of the largest utility companies in the Northeast United States, are already providing their data and sharing their knowledge with researchers at the UConn EEC."},{"type":"p","content":"Based on the above description, the research performed under this project can be classified under three topics: (i) Weather prediction; (ii) Outage prediction; (iii) Outage management and restoration.
