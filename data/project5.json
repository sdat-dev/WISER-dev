Pierro 2020) states that grid-connected PV has grown at the margin of a core of dispatchable and baseload conventional generation – a direct result of the resource’s intermittency. The challenge ahead for PV is to grow beyond this margin and acquire the grid-dominant position implied by 100%-renewables mandates in New York and elsewhere. As for wind, the transformation from inherently intermittent to firm power generation available 24/365 is a prerequisite to displacing the underlying conventional generation core and to acquiring the required grid-dominant position. New investigations (Perez 2020; Perez et al. 2019) by the proposer and others demonstrate that cost-optimal intermittent-to-firm transformation entails overbuilding and proactively curtailing PV to keep long-term storage costs acceptably low. This overbuild/curtail solution, -- referred as implicit storage (Perez et al. 2020) – could, by 2040, lead to firm, 100% penetration-ready PV generation costs comparable or below current dispatchable generation in all but very high latitude locations. The proposers recently outlined an economically effective pathway to transition from current unconstrained PV generation to future firm PV generation (Perez et al. 2020). This pathway entails gradually increasing firmness requirements, starting with firm power forecast -- entirely eliminating grid-operator uncertainty – and/or peak ramp minimization, and evolving towards 24/365 firm power requirements."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Research Scope: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"In the framework of the IUCRC and in collaboration with industry, we plan to explore fundamental technical and socio-economic aspects of implicit storage-enabled firm PV power generation that could include one or more of the following tasks:"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Task 1: Conducting pilot demonstrations of operationally firm forecasts and/or firm power generator."},{"type":"li","content":"Task 2: Conducting in-depth regional and/or localized simulations aimed at delineating optimal ultra-high penetration planning solutions (e.g., considering utility service areas or fraction thereof)."},{"type":"li","content":"Task 3: Delineating effective PV remuneration mechanisms that could foster firm power solutions – evolving from current unconstrained remuneration systems to systems embedding solutions to firm PV generation."},{"type":"li","content":"Task 4: Evaluating the impact of firm PV (wind) generation on wholesale electricity markets and investigating how these markets should evolve from a dispatchable conventional generation paradigm to a grid-dominant firm PV paradigm."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"While Task 1 would involve hardware/controls, hence building effective industry relationships, Tasks 2-4 could be implemented at the outset of the project and lead to first results/publication within the first year."},{"type":"p","content":"Our current research sponsor, Clean Power Research, will be a key industry partner to this effort, supplying both hi-res operational solar power forecast throughout North America and firm power generation optimization algorithms.
