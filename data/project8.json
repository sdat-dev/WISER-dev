Traditionally, these models rely on available weather forecasts along with either historical outage data specific to a utility or common damage patterns associated with specific weather hazards. These models frequently leave unconsidered other beneficial data such as local and upstream observational data or adjacent utility impacts (e.g., outages or customers affected). The presence of both a world-class observational network in New York (via the NYS Mesonet) as well as several friendly utilities have provided multiple avenues to demonstrate the improvement these datasets can provide if utilized properly. However, these are not entirely unique to New York, as many utilities operate their own observational weather networks, or have access to nearby networks. Most utilities also have “upwind” adjacent utilities or networks that can help inform models of impactful weather and the relationship between that weather and anticipated impacts.  Our existing NYS models can be nudged to fit outage needs across the U.S."},{"type":"p","content":"We propose to build upon existing “traditional” outage models built with forecasting tools and individual utility data by incorporating observational data as well as “outside” utility data to produce a superior outage prediction system for all weather hazards and for any region. Multiple outage prediction models have been created for NY and beyond by this research team, though these either (a) do not fully utilize available observational networks, and/or (b) do not consider utility impacts outside of the utility for which the model is created. These “ground truth” observations of both weather and impacts can allow for real-time adjustments of outage prediction models for individual utilities through proper machine learning."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Project Objectives: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"The primary objective of this project will be to build upon pre-existing outage prediction models by fully utilizing available operational networks such as the NYS Mesonet as well as freely available neighboring utility data available online in real-time. This will result in increased model accuracy, either by improving upon existing modeling frameworks through the inclusion of better data, and/or by evaluating those predictions in real-time by harnessing available weather conditions and utility impacts."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Experimental Plan: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"First, we will identify key observational weather networks such as statewide networks like the NYS Mesonet as well as utility-operated subnetworks. Second, sources of real-time utility outages will also be identified for relevant neighboring utilities. These can be obtained either from direct real-time feeds or by gathering publicly posted outage data in the form of online outage maps. Finally, available outage prediction model outputs will be gathered from participating utilities. Given the large variety in observational networks, outage data, and prediction models (e.g., some provide daily outputs, some are updated in real-time, some are only run when an event is anticipated), machine learning models will need to be developed to properly sort, analyze, and synthesize these datasets to produce real-time value."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Deliverables:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Two primary deliverables are anticipated"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"A list of all identified inputs for member utilities, including outage prediction models, observational networks, and real-time outage data."},{"type":"li","content":"Code for the machine learning software that processes the inputs and produces real-time adjustments for member utilities."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Timeline:</b> 3 years"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Milestones: </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Year 1: Identify observational networks, available outage data, and existing utility outage prediction models."},{"type":"li","content":"Year 2: Train machine-learning algorithms on these datasets to produce real-time adjustments."},{"type":"li","content":"Year 3: Implement these final machine-learned algorithms into member utility operations to improve local outage prediction."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"cthorncroft@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Christopher  Thorncroft ","project":"Project8","link":"albany.edu/daes/faculty/christopher-d-thorncroft"},{"email":"rfovell@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Rob Fovell","project":"Project8"},{"email":"alang@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Andrea Lang","project":"Project8"},{"email":"nbassil@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Nick Bassill","project":"Project8"},{"email":"jbrotzge@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Jerry Brotzge","project":"Project8"},{"email":"diego.cerrai@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":"Improving Outage Prediction by Utilizing Available Weather Networks and Utility Data","name":"Dr. Diego Cerrai","project":"Project8"}]}
