{"webelements":[{"type":"ph","content":"Power System Optimization Designs to Spur Renewable Energy Sources Adoption in a Changing Climate","logo":"renewableenergy-projects.jpg"},{"type":"p","content":"Renewable power generation, load density, and to some extent local energy markets are influenced by extreme heat, cold, and stormy conditions. In a changing climate and with the anticipated high penetration of renewable energy sources, the performance of future power systems will be radically dependent on how accurately weather is anticipated and how effectively the system integrates variable generation. There is an urgent need to develop a framework for the evaluation of power management algorithms that could guarantee reliability, lowest costs, transparency, and flexibility in present and future (climate change) scenarios. Such a framework will contain benchmarks for metrics, benefits, and costs in power grid designs. The results will help on identifying effective integration technologies and on recommending operation practices for the adoption of renewables sources. In collaboration with industry partners, this project will advance demonstrations of synergistic technologies in forecasting, economic dispatch optimization, and real-time power system simulations to evaluate renewable-based energy systems. A thorough assessment of the value of high-resolution, weather forecasting and dispatch optimization, especially at the community or neighborhood level will be conducted. Selected distribution systems will be used for the demonstrations, one that includes a utility-scale solar facility and another that includes an offshore wind energy farm. High resolution weather forecasting for solar and distribution circuit of targeted area will be provided by the industry project deliverables [1] and the local utilities. The results of this project will promote a shift to renewable sources that is not constrained to conventional power generation. It also assesses power grid designs that, depending on industrial partner interests, can include heating, smart buildings, DERs, and EV fleet management. Massively reducing carbon-related emissions and facilitating achieving net zero carbon solutions requires innovations in business and technology. The assessments in this project will determine the feasibility, scalability, and benefits of the solutions. Specific objectives include designing and testing grid-scale weather nowcasting, day-ahead, and long-range forecasting system of renewable energy production and loads, characterizing a progressive unit commitment and AC-optimal power flow framework for efficient use of renewable-based resources from both supply and demand sides with weather-based forecasting data, and developing software-in-the-loop platform between large-scale renewable-based systems simulated in RTDS and optimization and control center. New technologies will be tested and contrasted to improve the energy industry’s power grid efficiency and reliability in the face of higher penetration of renewables and intensification of weather extremes."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[]}
