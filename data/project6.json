{"webelements":[{"type":"ph","content":"Effectively Integrating Disparate Utility Operational Data Sources into Actionable Outage Management","logo":"outagemanagement-projects.jpg"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Background: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Utilities are frequently faced with extremely time-sensitive and expensive decisions, when preparing for and reacting to impactful weather events. In addition to frequent uncertainty regarding exact weather impacts (e.g., will the winds gust to 40 mph or 50 mph? will precipitation accumulate as heavy snow or wet rain?), a variety of ancillary factors directly modulate these decisions. These may be utility-centric factors such as staffing readiness, crew positioning, mutual assistance demands and availability, or situational factors such as vegetation or ease of transportation. As an event unfolds, these factors must further be incorporated into decisions based on real-time situational awareness of where the weather is impacting, and how it may differ from expectations."},{"type":"p","content":"Successfully navigating these disparate data sources can be the difference in timely restoration, efficiency, and cost savings. However, realizing these benefits requires a clear understanding of how to obtain this information efficiently, how these pieces connect to one another, and what actions are most likely to succeed. We propose to build a data management framework, which leverages close coordination with member utilities and results in visualization tools, to concisely display and incorporate all relevant operational information – (integrated meteorological and operational information) such as human resource staffing, logistical systems, and other enterprise resource planning systems) to support utilities in making the most effective decisions."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Project Objectives: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"This project has several key objectives. First, develop a platform to integrate disparate data sources for query and display. This platform will be comprised of static and dynamic data sources. This will be done in close coordination with member utilities that will then utilize this platform to power real-time outage management decision-making, such as staffing decisions and pre-deployment strategies."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Experimental Plan: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"First, we will identify external data sources as well as key stakeholders within member utilities. The external data sources will include: (a) real-time weather data, such as the data provided by NOAA and the NYS Mesonet; (b) available outage prediction and/or weather prediction models; (c) static metadata, including utility infrastructure, treecover, etc., (d) historical data, such as weather archives and outage histories, and (e) ongoing wildfires and wildfire risk. Second, develop an integrated platform and process for combining and querying multiple data sources, with visualization created with input from utilities stakeholders. Finally, develop AI-based suggested decision-making tools for staffing and pre-deployment strategies for forecast outage events and integrate them into the visualization platform."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Deliverables: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"Two primary deliverables are:"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"AI-based software available for use by utilities to aid in decision-making for managing power outages."},{"type":"li","content":"A visualization platform to integrate and display disparate data sources, as well as the above AI-based software to inform decision-making."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Timeline:</b> 3 years"},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Milestones: </b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Year 1: Identify utility stakeholders and identify/acquire data streams."},{"type":"li","content":"Year 2: Working visualization platform able to ingest/display most external data sources as needed."},{"type":"li","content":"Year 3: Working version of AI software able to provide “best-case” decision-making for power outage management and staffing decisions.
