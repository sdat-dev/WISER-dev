Our vegetation management projects build on substantial prior work by the UConn \r\nStormwise program and the Eversource Energy Center, both of which combine academic research and \r\nextension programs in a collaborative relationship with industry partners (Eversource, Avangrid) and \r\ngovernmental agencies (CT Dept. of Energy and Environmental Protection, CT Public Utility Regulatory \r\nAuthority). The research and practical implementation information developed in WISER are broadly relevant \r\nto utility programs across all geographies and could help to promote grid resilience nationally in the face of \r\nincreasing storm frequency and severity. The proposed research would help improve broad scale \r\nmanagement of forests to reduce risk to infrastructure, forest damage and resulting losses of ecological \r\nand economic productivity. \""},{"type":"ul","content":"num-list"},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""}]
