Economic literature generates likely economic costs by duration but is not industry specific by locale.  UConn has developed a system resilience model to link local weather conditions and power outages with modeling physical power distribution system. Integrating spatially-specific, modelled resiliency initiatives with dynamic economic analysis reveals how improvements to the system will identify efficient capital investment strategies for utility companies, while delivering long-term benefits to state and regional economies."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Research plan:  </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"The WISER’s site at UConn proposes a project to address the system resilience assessment challenges by integrating the capabilities of UConn’s Outage Prediction Model (OPM), the Performance Assessment Group (PAG) Total System Resilience Model (SRM), and Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis (CCEA) REMI model to develop holistic analyses of resilience options.  SRM will update and augment fragility curves by incorporating correlation of parameters, such as soil, topographic relief, weather, wind, pole conditions, and vegetation status. This will allow the development of multivariable fragility curves (i.e., response surface-fragility surface). OPM will generate predictive statistics of scenario-based extreme parameters for outage predictions and time-series of weather events and outages; these statistics then frame SRM predictions as time-series of power outages under different interventions or conditions scenarios.  The PAG team will evaluate different resilience options and tactics under alternative disruption scenarios using cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. PAG will then assess trade-offs between system impact and recovery cost and develop a system-level optimization model to optimally allocate resources and resilience strategies within budget constraints."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>System resilience:</b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Enhance understanding of pole failures through creation off fragility surfaces from incorporation of correlation of parameters, such as soil, topography, weather, wind, pole conditions, and vegetation status."},{"type":"li","content":"Predict damage resulting from power outages as a function of their duration and severity in current and future climate conditions."},{"type":"li","content":"Quantify the reduction in damages during storms and blue-sky conditions through counterfactual analysis."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Economic analysis:</b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"Evaluate utility resiliency investments on the electric grid."},{"type":"li","content":"Evaluate benefits of resiliency investments to local economies."},{"type":"li","content":"Develop models to optimally allocate resources and to identify resilience strategies under budget constraints."},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>RESEARCHERS:</b>"}],"members":[{"email":"amvrossios.bagtzoglou@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":"Dr.  Amvrossios Bagtzoglou","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#AmvrossiosBagtzoglou"},{"email":"ekstern@albany.edu","university":"UAlbany","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":"Dr. Eric Stern","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#EricStern"},{"email":"jin.zhu@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":"Dr. Jin Zhu ","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#JinZhu"},{"email":"marcello.graziano@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":" Macello Graziano","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#MacelloGraziano"},{"email":"wei.zhang@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":" Wei Zhang","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#WeiZhang"},{"email":"maria.chrysochoou@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":" Maria Chrysochoou","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#MariaChrysochoou"},{"email":"fred.carstensen@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":" Fred Carstensen","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#FredCarstensen"},{"email":"peter.gunther@uconn.edu","university":"UConn","projecttitle":{"Title":"System Resilience and Economic Analysis","Number":"Project1"},"name":" Peter Gunther","project":"Project1","link":"researchers.html#PeterGunther"}]}
