Standard vegetation management and enhanced tree trimming practices address potential tree-related issues and challenges within the utility protection zone (UPZ) and have been shown by UConn researchers to reduce outage frequency (Parent et al. 2019). Both are costly programs and can affect the ecological and aesthetic qualities of roadside trees and forests. Utility vegetation management programs also critically rely on public acceptance and regulatory approval to balance tradeoffs among maintaining reliable power, acquisition of resources for vegetation management programs, and conserving aesthetic characteristics of the roadside forest."},{"type":"p","content":"However, vegetation management restricted to the narrow UPZ has limited potential to reduce damage and outages in storm conditions because a considerable component of the damage is generally associated with failure of trees outside the UPZ. Forest management approaches implemented beyond the UPZ have the potential to substantially impact outages associated with storms. Researchers in the “Stormwise” forest management program at UConn have been developing and testing novel roadside management approaches for almost a decade. Initial results have indicated that Stormwise management can alter tree biomechanics and promote tree stability in roadside forests (Bunce et al. 2019) and suggest that implementation of these approaches could reduce storm-related outages. However, such approaches can be extremely difficult to implement due to lack of regulatory authority and the wide variety of landowners and stakeholders represented in the overall roadside forest. Social science research at UConn has revealed heterogeneous perceptions of vegetation management among the public, and that land management decisions are diverse and vary with stakeholder objectives and landscape attributes (Hale and Morzillo 2020; DiFalco and Morzillo 2021; Kloster et al. 2020; Kloster et al. in press). In addition, disturbances other than storms (e.g., drought, insect defoliation, pathogen outbreaks) can lead to forest health problems and result in lowered resistance of forests to damage and limited positive response of trees to vegetation management (i.e., reduced biomechanical response to trimming or forest thinning). There is a critical need to (i) understand and predict the potential impact of combinations of resilience-focused vegetation management approaches (within and outside the UPZ) on overall forest and infrastructure resistance to storm damage, (ii) identify socio-ecological opportunities and barriers to implementation of vegetation management programs and develop mitigation strategies to overcome barriers, and (iii) develop modeling approaches to optimize the allocation of resources, management interventions, and outreach efforts."},{"type":"p","content":"The WISER’s site at UConn proposes a project that will use geospatial analysis, biomechanics data associated with tree and forest manipulations, stakeholder-based outreach and extension activities, and social science data collection to understand the potential utility of various approaches to promote resilience of the roadside forest while also considering social and cultural forest values. Our specific objectives are to: 1) assess and predict the impact of vegetation management options and interacting forest disturbances on tree stability and overall roadside forest resistance to storm damage."},{"type":"p","content":"2) Evaluate opportunities and barriers to vegetation management treatments addressing multiple stressors affecting tree failure and stability, 3) investigate the potential for vegetation management options to produce co-benefits related to ecosystem services that are important to human society and people’s experience of the exurban forest landscape, and 4) develop enhanced decision support frameworks that integrate data sources to prioritize selection of treatment areas and optimize investment of vegetation management effort."},{"type":"p","content":"We propose a multi-faceted research program that will produce actionable and societally relevant information to support collaborative efforts by forest management professionals, extension and outreach professionals, utility companies, municipalities, governmental regulators and agencies, private landowners, and research scientists to promote storm resilience in the roadside forest socio-ecological system.
