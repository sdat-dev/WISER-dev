A DERMS is expected to control and operate DERs in a coordinated manner. Clearly, an effective and reliable DERMS could help with the integration of high DERs penetrations while improving grid resiliency, reliability and economic. In existing DERMS, the coordination of various DERs is achieved via some optimization models, where accurate feeder model and sufficient sensor data are required. The optimization model is difficult to solve due to the nonlinear power flow constraints and the lack of load information across the whole network at every time step. However, in practical distribution system operation, the DER controllers do not have the real-time load injection measurements for all nodes and the secondary feeder models are of very low quality. There are also works based on the design of autonomous volt-var/watt control but the system-wide coordination is lacking, and thus they do not guarantee the satisfaction of system-level optimality when providing utility grid services. For utilities without DERMS or advanced distribution management systems (ADMS), advanced control/optimization algorithms to securely and reliably integrated DERs are needed."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Research Plan:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"This project will develop a novel data driven DERMS that is scalable, modular, and flexible, allowing utilities to meet current needs, and grow as circumstances dictate. This novel data driven DERMS solution as shown in the right figure is achieved by developing a new voltage sensitivity enabled feedback optimization framework that allows the coordinated control of any types of DERs. Grid measurements from smart meters and DERs are gathered and provided to the optimization algorithm. With data-driven sensitivity index, the optimization model is formulated as a linear programming problem to diminish computational complexity and hence enable a measurement-feedback online scheme. The proposed solution does not need the load knowledge across the feeder and can be implemented online thanks to fast solver for linear programing problem. This DERMS online platform is generalizable to deal with various types of DERs including PVs, energy storage, electric vehicles, demand response, etc."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Specific Objectives: :</b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":"System-level Optimization: Different from the local autonomous control, 3D-DERMS achieves coordination among various types of DERs to reach system-level objectives."},{"type":"li","content":"Data-Driven Analysis: Accurate models of distribution grids are hard to obtain.
