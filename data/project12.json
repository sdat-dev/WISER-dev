A DERMS is expected to control and operate DERs in a coordinated manner. Clearly, an effective and reliable DERMS could help with the integration of high DERs penetrations while improving grid resiliency, reliability and economic. In existing DERMS, the coordination of various DERs is achieved via some optimization models, where accurate feeder model and sufficient sensor data are required. The optimization model is difficult to solve due to the nonlinear power flow constraints and the lack of load information across the whole network at every time step. However, in practical distribution system operation, the DER controllers do not have the real-time load injection measurements for all nodes and the secondary feeder models are of very low quality. There are also works based on the design of autonomous volt-var/watt control but the system-wide coordination is lacking, and thus they do not guarantee the satisfaction of system-level optimality when providing utility grid services. For utilities without DERMS or advanced distribution management systems (ADMS), advanced control/optimization algorithms to securely and reliably integrated DERs are needed."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Research Plan:</b>"},{"type":"p","content":"This project will develop a novel data driven DERMS that is scalable, modular, and flexible, allowing utilities to meet current needs, and grow as circumstances dictate. This novel data driven DERMS solution as shown in the right figure is achieved by developing a new voltage sensitivity enabled feedback optimization framework that allows the coordinated control of any types of DERs. Grid measurements from smart meters and DERs are gathered and provided to the optimization algorithm. With data-driven sensitivity index, the optimization model is formulated as a linear programming problem to diminish computational complexity and hence enable a measurement-feedback online scheme. The proposed solution does not need the load knowledge across the feeder and can be implemented online thanks to fast solver for linear programing problem. This DERMS online platform is generalizable to deal with various types of DERs including PVs, energy storage, electric vehicles, demand response, etc."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Specific Objectives: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":"2. Forest structure modelling: Our previous research has shown that the Connecticut statewide LiDAR dataset, which is freely available, can accurately model various tree and forest characteristics include canopy height and density. Roughness indices can be developed and applied to LiDAR-based canopy height models to identify the prevalence of trees protruding above the forest canopy. Connecticut is covered by multi-temporal LiDAR datasets which can allow for forest disturbances to be mapped over 2-to-6-year time periods depending on the location in the state.  Connecticut’s Changing Landscape (CCL) land cover data can allow for longer-term forest disturbances to be identified, although at a coarser resolution. This task will use freely available statewide LiDAR and land cover datasets to model forest canopy roughness and closure as well as changes in the forest edge location. Each model will be integrated into the “proximity tree” model developed in previous work (Parent et al. 2019) which indicates the locations of risk trees which are within striking distance of power lines. We will identify and quantify the risk associated by each forest disturbances per conductor-mile. Eversource’s outage data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of these integrated models in predicting outages. Models will be incorporated into the decision support tool based on either empirical evidence or strong support from the scientific literature."},{"type":"p","content":"3. Rapid post-storm damage assessment: Low-cost UASs can be rapidly deployed by utility personnel to evaluate damages and acquire first-hand information, such as downed trees, power lines, and poles. Multispectral and thermals cameras and 3D laser scanning sensors can be vested on UASs to acquire detailed information about the storm damage.  When the UAS deployments coupled with commercial satellite products, such as Planet satellites that collect images of the entire globe every day with a resolution of 3 m, it is possible to readily scale-up post-damage assessments to large areas. Satellite imagery from past events and UASs flights outfitted with multiple sensors over simulated scenarios will be used as baseline information to explore the potentials of platforms/data and to develop automated algorithms. We will closely collaborate with our utility partner – Eversource Energy - to scope their specific UAS-based mapping needs in post-storm situations. Based on their inputs we will develop new algorithms enabled with software interfacing to produce UAS-based analytics."},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Specific Objectives: :</b>"},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Milestones: </b>"},{"type":"p","content":""},{"type":"ul","content":"dot-list"},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"li","content":""},{"type":"/ul","content":""},{"type":"p","content":"<b>Researchers:</b>"}],"members":[]}
