WindSTAR conducts wind energy research \r\nwith an aim to increase the production of this low-carbon energy source through an engineering focus. The \r\nproposed WISE IUCRC is unique and differs from WindStar in that it is focused on transformative weather\u0002driven smart energy research through atmospheric and environmental science."}]
